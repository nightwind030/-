# Discord Command: /clear channel messages
[<img src="https://open.autocode.com/static/images/open.svg?" width="192">](https://open.autocode.com/)

This is a simple app that adds a `/clear` command to your Discord server.
You can specify the number of lines to clear, with `0` clearing all channel history.

The `/clear` command will automatically be created on the first guild your
bot is connected to when the app is installed. If you need to create the command
again for any reason, you can trigger the `functions/events/autocode/self/deployed.js`
endpoint by running it in Autocode.

Enjoy!
