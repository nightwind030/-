# Set up instructions
Provide your guild ID in the Environment variables. This will allow the command to be automatically created. Alternatively, you can create the command yourself using [Autocode's command builder](https://autocode.com/tools/discord/command-builder/).

After the command has been created, run `/pronoun-prompt` in the server that you want to set it up and select the channel the prompt should be in. That's all!
